# Fake_Job_Detection

# 🚩 Fake Job Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake job postings are a growing threat in online recruitment. In this project, I built a machine learning-based solution to classify job listings as **fraudulent or real**. The solution includes data cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, Random Forest classification, and a user-friendly **Streamlit web app** for real-time prediction.
